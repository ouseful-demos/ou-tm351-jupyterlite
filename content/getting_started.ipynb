Sublist items can be created indenting a list item.\n\nHeaders can be included in a markdown cell by prefixing text with one or more `#` signs, correspinding to the cell heading level (for example, `## A level 2 heading`). If a markdown cell starts with a heading, a collapsible cell indicator will be displayed in the rendered cell view that allows you to collapse all cells underneath that heading cell up to the next markdown cell that starts with the same or higher level heading.\n\nThe Jupyter markdown editor will preview the styling that will be applied by the use of markdown tags, where possible.\n\nIn markdown cell edit mode, markdown text and code comments are also passed through a spell-checker that highlights words that contain spelling errors.\n\nYou can view the rendered form of a markdown cell by \"running\" it in the same way that you would run a code cell, using `SHIFT-ENTER`, or from clicking the notebook play button.\n\nDouble click on a rendered markdown cell to return it to the edit mode.",
